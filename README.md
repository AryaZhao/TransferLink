# TransferLink
Designed social network website to connect transfer students to their peers, helping them integrate into the community

## Description
Our website is to serve the transfer, combined-plan and visiting students to better accustomed to the new academic and social environment. Each year, Columbia has 100 CC transfer students, 30 SEAS transfers and 160 Combined-Plan students. They have very different educational paths and have less time to adjust to the new environment. So we aim to design social network database to help this population to know more about the former transfers/visiting students and their academic paths.

## Features
If the user input the name of previous school, this website will output a list of transfer/visiting/combined-plan students who transferred to Columbia from that school, and a list of Columbia professors who graduated from that school. If the user types in a studentâ€™s name from that list, he/she can also see what courses, researches, clubs the student is in. The student can also type in what club they want to join, which courses they want to take, and the system will give a list of transfer/combined plan students who attend the clubs. The system may also let the user to store a list of researches/clubs he/she is interested in, and may be able to recommend the people who might be appropriate to contact. Finally, system should be able to let users type in department name for list of professor and research opportunities.
